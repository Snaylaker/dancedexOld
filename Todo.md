End point :
Have a list of gifs that represent the moves that i want to learn
Maybe i will just extract mp4 videos from youtube instead of gifs those seem such a hastle and plus it would be nice to kind of have a player

I Will start by manually extracting like 4 videos first and display them properly
then do something that does the extracting for me with some api
then i will use some kind of database for managing the info
then maybe host this stuff

how about adding some moves ? /deleting maybe all of the crud thingys ? let see if i use it first before this ?
maybe a check list for learned or not ?
curently learning list as well ?

### what do i need minmum ot use this

probably just for it to be hosted somewhere and and have a decent display on mobile with like 5 moves i want to learn

### so reacp

    Mobile first
    Hosted
    Youtube Clips
